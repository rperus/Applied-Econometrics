## encode x and prob as vectors
x <- c(2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
prob <-c(1/25,2/25,3/25,4/25,5/25,4/25,3/25,2/25,1/25)

##  Calculate the mean
mean<-sum(x*prob)

## calculate the variance and SD
variance <- sum(((x-mean)^2)*prob)
stddev <- sqrt(variance)   

## create a dataframe with x and prob vectors
dataframe <- data.frame(x,prob)

## calculate and add cumulative probabilities
dataframe$cumprob <- cumsum(dataframe[,2])


## Plot Probability Distribution
plot(x,prob, type="b",    
     main="Probability distribution of the sum of two balls drawn from the two boxes",
     ylab="Probability",
     xlab="Sum of two balls drawn from the two boxes"
     )



## Plot Probability Cumulative Distribution
plot(x,dataframe$cumprob, type="b",    
              main="Cumulative probability distribution of the sum of two balls drawn from the two boxes",
              ylab="Cumulative probability",
              xlab="Sum of two balls drawn from the two boxes"
)
